# Lung_Cancer_Detection

This project aims to detect lung cancer from CT-Scan images using deep learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains CT-Scan images of Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, Squamous cell carcinoma, and normal cells. The dataset can be found here.

Dataset Description
The CT-Scan images are in jpg or png format to fit the model. The dataset contains four main folders:

Adenocarcinoma: contains CT-Scan images of Adenocarcinoma of the lung. Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for 30% of all cases overall and about 40% of all non-small cell lung cancer occurrences.

Large cell carcinoma: contains CT-Scan images of Large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. This type of lung cancer usually accounts for 10 to 15% of all cases of NSCLC.

Squamous cell carcinoma: contains CT-Scan images of Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. This type of lung cancer is responsible for about 30% of all non-small cell lung cancers, and is generally linked to smoking.

Normal: contains CT-Scan images of normal cells.
